# Camera Management System
Project Overview
This project is a Camera Management System, developed in C++, focusing on multi-threading, file operations, and client-server communication. The system is designed to be efficient, reliable, and maintainable, with special attention to code clarity and proper synchronization techniques.

Key Features
Multithreading: Use of threads to handle concurrent camera operations.

Synchronization Mechanisms: Implementation of locking and synchronization primitives to ensure thread safety and avoid race conditions.

Bit-Level Operations: Efficient use of bit manipulation for compact data handling and control flags.

File I/O: Reading from and writing to files for logging, configuration, and persistent data storage.

Client-Server Communication: Custom communication protocol for managing and controlling cameras remotely.

Clean and Maintainable Code: Focus on readable, well-documented, and structured C++ code.

Technologies Used
C++ Standard Library

POSIX Threads (or std::thread depending on the platform)

Custom protocols for inter-process and network communication

File system APIs for persistent storage

Design Highlights
Thread-safe architecture with clear separation of responsibilities.

Modular design for scalability and future extension (e.g., adding support for new camera types or protocols).

Emphasis on performance, stability, and real-world usability.
